The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.",

Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells.

Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards.
